                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <h3>Welcome to Empowering The Nation</h3>
                <p>We at Empowering the Nation believe that everyone should have the opportunity to flourish. Precious Radebe launched our business in 2018 with the goal of providing gardeners and domestic workers with the information and resources they need to advance their careers and embrace new opportunities.</p>

                <h3>Why We Were Founded</h3>
<p>
    Empowering the Nation was born from a deep-seated need to support those who, like Preciousâ€™s own parents 
    and family members, may not have had the same opportunities to gain formal training or upskilling. Understanding 
    firsthand the limitations that many face due to a lack of resources, our founder saw the potential for a 
    program that could help people transform their futures. Since 2018, our goal has been to bridge this gap 
    and provide people with the chance to grow, learn, and thrive.
</p>

<h3>Impact on the Community</h3>
<p>
    Beyond individual training, Empowering the Nation plays a role in strengthening communities. Each person 
    we train has the potential to inspire others, contribute economically, and ultimately help reduce unemployment 
    within the community. With every skilled worker, we create a ripple effect, spreading positive change that 
    uplifts families, neighborhoods, and the greater Johannesburg area.
